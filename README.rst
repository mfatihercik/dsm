============

Declarative Stream Mapping(DSM) is a stream deserializer library that works for both XML and JSON. DSM allows you to make custom parsing, filtering, transforming, aggregating, grouping on any JSON or XML document at stream time(read only once). There is no need to writing custom parser. DSM use yaml or json configuration file to parse data. Processed data can be deserialized to java classes.
